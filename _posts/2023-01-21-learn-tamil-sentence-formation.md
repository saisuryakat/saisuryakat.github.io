## Sentence formation

For Telugu people, there is not much to learn in sentence formation as the way of expression is almost identical between Telugu and Tamil.<br>
Just think of a sentence in Telugu and swap the Telugu words with the equivalent Tamil words, that is all.

### Examples

- **Telugu**: మీ పేరు ఏంటి? (మీ పేరేంటి?)
- **Tamil**: Unga per enna? (Unga perenna?)
