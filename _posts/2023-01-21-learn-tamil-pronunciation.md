## Guidance on Pronunciation

Even though the Telugu transliteration of the Tamil words is given above, they are not pronounced exactly as they are written in Telugu.

Telugu is an Ajanta Bhasha(ending with an Vowel sound), Tamil like other languages(English) is a Halantha Bhasha, so if we speak/end Tamil words smoothly with an vowel sound
they will immediately catch that we are not a native Tamil speaker. One should end words with sharp cut.

Eg: Irukku - ఇరుక్కు should be ended with sharp cut of consonant K - క్క్ and not క్కు.
Also the ru sound is not రు but ర్
This is something to be learnt by listening either directly or by watching movies
