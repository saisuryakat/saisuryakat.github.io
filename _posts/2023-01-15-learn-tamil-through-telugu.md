Tamil is one of the classical languages...not only of India but also of the world. It is a Dravidian Language primarily spoken by the people of Tamil Nadu.

Learning Tamil is relatively easy for South Indians especially for Telugu people because Telugu Language(like other Dravidian Languages) is influenced by Tamil.

For easier understanding and convenience, the learning is divided into the following Chapters.
Please do remember that the structure given is based on my way of learning being a Telugu speaker, I hope that the structure would be useful
for others too.

## Miscellaneous Observations

> Usage of plural(for nouns) is not very strict in Tamil unlike Telugu, so most of the colloquial conversations takes place in singular only
{: .prompt-info }

**Eg**: How many fruits have you brought?  
**Telugu**: Enni pandlu techavu?  
**Tamil**: - Ethna Pazham konduvandite?  
**Observation**: Notice Pazham is used instead of Plural Pazhamgal  
**-gal** is used to make plural of nouns etc in Tamil, like **-lu** is used in Telugu

> There is no letter ha(హ) in Tamil Alphabet which brings a huge difference in pronunciation, any common words (esp Sanskrit words) are pronounced very differently compared to Telugu and intonations requiring ha sound will be pronounced without
